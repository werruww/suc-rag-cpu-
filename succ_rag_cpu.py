Understanding Climate Change
Chapter 1: Introduction to Climate Change
Climate change refers to significant, long-term changes in the global climate. The term
"global climate" encompasses the planet's overall weather patterns, including temperature,
precipitation, and wind patterns, over an extended period. Over the past century, human
activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, have significantly
contributed to climate change.
Historical Context
The Earth's climate has changed throughout history. Over the past 650,000 years, there have
been seven cycles of glacial advance and retreat, with the abrupt end of the last ice age about
11,700 years ago marking the beginning of the modern climate era and human civilization.
Most of these climate changes are attributed to very small variations in Earth's orbit that
change the amount of solar energy our planet receives. During the Holocene epoch, which
began at the end of the last ice age, human societies flourished, but the industrial era has seen
unprecedented changes.
Modern Observations
Modern scientific observations indicate a rapid increase in global temperatures, sea levels,
and extreme weather events. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has
documented these changes extensively. Ice core samples, tree rings, and ocean sediments
provide a historical record that scientists use to understand past climate conditions and
predict future trends. The evidence overwhelmingly shows that recent changes are primarily
driven by human activities, particularly the emission of greenhouse gases.
Chapter 2: Causes of Climate Change
Greenhouse Gases
The primary cause of recent climate change is the increase in greenhouse gases in the
atmosphere. Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous
oxide (N2O), trap heat from the sun, creating a "greenhouse effect." This effect is essential
for life on Earth, as it keeps the planet warm enough to support life. However, human
activities have intensified this natural process, leading to a warmer climate.
Fossil Fuels
